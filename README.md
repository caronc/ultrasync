## How Does It Work?

1. First you need to install it; this part is easy:

   ```bash
   # Install ultrasync onto your system
   pip install ultrasync
   ```

2. Create a configuration file that identifies:
   1. The location the ComNav/ZeroWire hub can be found on some network.
   1. Your ComNav/ZeroWire login User ID
   1. Your ComNav/ZeroWire login pin

   **Note**: You can only be logged into the ComNav/ZeroWire hub with the same user *once*; a subsequent login with the same user logs out the other. Since this tool/software actively polls and maintains a login session to your Hub, it can prevent you from being able to log into at the same time elsewhere (via it's website).  It is strongly recommended you create a second user account on your Hub dedicated to just this service.

   ```yaml
   # An example of what would be found in your configuration file:
   # Use hashtags/pound symbols (#) to optionally add comments
   # Syntax is simply <key>: <value>
   #
   # You must specify hostname, user, and pin
   #
   host: 192.168.0.30
   user: My Username
   pin: 1234
   ```

3. Use the **--scene** (*-s*) to set your security system's alarm scene.  The possible options are: `disarm`, `away`, and `stay`.

   ```bash
   # By default if no --config= (-c) is specified; one will be automatically
   # loaded from the following location (if present):
   #  ~/.ultrasync
   #  ~/.config/ultrasync

   # Windows users can store their default configuration files here:
   #  %APPDATA%/UltraSync/config
   #  %LOCALAPPDATA%/UltraSync/config

   # Disarm your security system
   ultrasync --scene disarm

   # Arm your security system and activate all of your sensors when setting the
   # away mode macro
   ultrasync --scene away

   # Arm your security system and only activate your perimeter sensors:
   ultrasync --scene stay
   ```

## What Else Can It Do?

- You can put up a live monitor of your device by typing the following:

  ```bash
  # A live monitoring of your home security system:
  ultrasync --watch
  ```
![UltraSync Watch Mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caronc/ultrasync/master/static/ultrasync-watch.gif)

- You can generate a snapshot (in JSON format) that greatly details everything taking place through your security home setup. It provides MUCH greater detail than the `--watch` which allows it to also be integrated with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ultrasync/).

  ```bash
  # Print a JSON formatted snapshot of all home security details
  ultrasync --details
  ```

- You can perform a dump of all of the web based files (*that I've found to be useful so far*) to disk.  This makes troubleshooting incredibly much easier.

  ```bash
  # Extracts information from your UltraSync Hub that can be
  # incredibly useful in debugging and/or adding enhancements
  ultrasync --debug-dump
  ```

  The debug content gets written to a zip file (residing in the same folder you ran this command from) in the form of: `YYYYmmddHHMMSS.ultrasync-dump.zip`.

## Reverse Proxy

If you've exposed your panel to the internet, you can access it by setting your `host` to the full URL to it.  For example:

```yaml
# A sample ultrasync configuration that requires you to pass through
# a proxy in order to get to your destination:
host: https://your.security.panel/
user: My Username
pin: 1234
```

If you've also protected your panel behind an additional user/pass combo using Basic Auth at the reverse proxy, you can pass through it like so:

```yaml
# A sample ultrasync configuration that requires you to pass through
# a proxy expecting authentication in order to get to your destination:
host: https://user:pass@your.security.panel/
user: My Username
pin: 1234
```

## Disclaimer

This software was created by reverse engineering my own personal security system. All of this code was generated through trial and error since there is no documentation that I could find that explains the registers. If you can help out by filling in some of the blanks throughout the code base, I would be greatly appreciative of it! Alternatively [buying me a coffee](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=MHANV39UZNQ5E) greatly inspires me to continue improving the application.

Otherwise, please feel free to file bugs and use this at your sole discretion as I have no control over how your own security system might have been set up. But what has been written here *should* work for all owners.
